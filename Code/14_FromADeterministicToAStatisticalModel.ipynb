    "Spores are inherently heterogeneous, exhibiting a variation in their size and physiology, which affects their characteristic inhibitor release time, initial concentration and threshold of germination inhibition. This results in empirical experiments observing a gradual change in the germination percentage under changing environmental conditions, instead of a binary switch from a fully germinated to a fully non-germinated inoculum. This notebook attempts to address the statistical distributions of the different parameters in the established analytical formula, so that the model can be fitted to existing experimental data."
