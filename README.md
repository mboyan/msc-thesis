# Master Thesis
Includes materials for Master's Thesis Project

## Notes for coordination meeting - 13.09.24

**Questions**
- Scope: 42 EC; Is there a relevant question for Han's research group which would benefit from dedicated research into Computational Modelling of mycelium?
- Focus: inoculation of substrate by spores/mycelium; relevance for biofabrication, microecology, ...
- Definition of objectives: modelling an observed phenomenon under assumptions of mathematical abstractions; consolidating knowledge; bridging micro- and macroscopic scales; making predictions on hypothetical scenarios without having to grow samples physically; looking for quantifiable complex system phenomena (pattern formations, density distributions, steady-states/equilibria or other types of dynamics);
- Mentioned examples: mutual inhibition and synergistic behavior between spores of different species; spore clustering under different adhesive conditions;
- Verification through data - what sort of arrangements can be made on data use; only focus on publically available data? NDA? What are typical requirements from the programme? 
- Availability for irl meeting/visit to lab in Utrecht.
